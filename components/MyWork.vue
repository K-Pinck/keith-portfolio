        Here is a small sample of my work, showcasing the diverse range of
        projects I've had the pleasure of working on. From beautifully crafted
        WordPress websites to dynamic Vue/Nuxt.js applications, this portfolio
        reflects the breadth of my expertise. Each project encapsulates a unique
        challenge and an opportunity to push creative boundaries.
